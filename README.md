*) Once the local repository on your system is up to date, YOU HAVE A CHOICE! If you want a slightly more challenging assignment, use the code in the "harder" folder as your starting point. If you want a slightly less challenging assignment, use the code in the "easier" folder as your starting point. The difference between the two starting points is that in the "easier" starting point, there are a few steps that are already completed for you.

Harder: If you want a slightly more challenging assignment, copy all the contents of the fullstack-course4/assignments/assignment4/assignment4-solution-starter/harder folder into your newly created solutions container folder for this assignment, e.g., 'module4-solution'.
-Easier: If you want a slightly less challenging assignment, copy all the contents of the fullstack-course4/assignments/assignment4/assignment4-solution-starter/easier folder into your newly created solutions container folder for this assignment, e.g., 'module4-solution'.

NOTE: the provided starter code will not run. It is up to you to follow the instructions to get it to run. Once you've copied the starter code of your choice into your solution folder, open up your solution folder in the code editor. Open up script.js file and follow the steps.

*) When you are continuously working on the assignment, use Browser Sync and keep Chrome open to the Console tab of the Chrome Developer Tools. You will likely see errors there to start with. Follow the steps outlined in the starter code and those errors should go away by the time you finish the last step. If you still see errors at that point or you are not seeing the output you're supposed to see, you probably made a mistake somewhere, so look into that and investigate.

Remember, if you are stuck, ask questions on the course Discussion forum.

*) That's it!
